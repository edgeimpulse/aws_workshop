## Cleanup

**AWS workshop attendees**: The temporary AWS account given to you will automatically be deleted. No other action is necessary at this time. 

**Personal AWS Accounts**: To minimize costs of your AWS resources, you can go to the AWS IoTCore Greengrass deployments page and revise your deployment. In the revision, remove the Edge Impulse custom component from the deployment and redeploy. This will shutdown the "runner" service on your edge device and will no longer send messages into IoTCore when inference results are present. 


### Thank you for attending the workshop!
